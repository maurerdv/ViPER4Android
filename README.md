## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/likelikeslike/ViPER4Android/releases)
2. Install the APK
3. Flash the Magisk module from [ViPERFX_RE](https://github.com/likelikeslike/ViPERFX_RE) (or the AIDL variant)
4. Reboot
5. Open the app and tune the settings.
6. Enjoy

## Q&A

- **What is Global Mode?**

    > Creates a single AudioEffect on session ID 0 (the global mix). The Android audio framework
    > routes all audio through session 0, so one effect instance processes everything. This is the
    > simplest and most compatible mode.

- **What is Per-App Mode?**

    > Creates a separate AudioEffect for each audio player's session ID. The DSP processes each
    > app's audio independently. Requires root access.

- **Why does Per-App Mode require root?**

    > On modern Android (API 34+ / Android 14+), the framework no longer broadcasts
    > `OPEN_AUDIO_EFFECT_CONTROL_SESSION`, and `AudioManager.getActivePlaybackConfigurations()`
    > returns anonymized session IDs (`sessionId:0, u/pid:-1/-1`). The app uses `AudioPlaybackCallback`
    > to detect playback state changes, then retrieves the real session ID via `su -c "dumpsys audio"`, which requires root.

- **What is Per-Device Profile?**

    > Each audio device (e.g., "Galaxy Buds Pro", "Airpods", "Speaker") keeps its own saved effect
    > settings, loaded automatically on connect and saved when the app goes to the background. See [Per-Device Profiles](#per-device-profiles) for details.

- **What is AIDL Mode?**
    > Android 14+ introduced a new Audio HAL interface based on AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language),
    > replacing the legacy HIDL interface. If your device's audio HAL uses AIDL, enable this in Settings.

## Presets

Presets are stored in the **v2 grouped-JSON format** (`schemaVersion: 2`):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "name": "My Preset",
  "masterEnable": true,
  "equalizer": { "enable": true, "bandCount": 10, "bands": [3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0], "presetId": null },
  "dynamicEq": { "enable": false, "bandCount": 4, "freqs": [...], "gains": [...] },
  "ddc": { "enable": false, "device": "" }
}
```

### Migrating v1 / legacy presets to v2

v2 is **not** compatible with the old flat v1 JSON or the legacy ViPER4Android XML presets. Two migration paths are available:

1. **In-app export (recommended).** In the last v1 app release (1.5.5), use *Export preset as v2* to produce a `.v2.json` file, then import it in v2.
2. **Command-line tool.** For v1 JSON or legacy XML presets, use [`tools/convert_preset.py`](tools/convert_preset.py) (Python 3.11+):

   ```bash
   # v1 flat JSON  ->  v2
   python3 tools/convert_preset.py preset.json -o preset.v2.json

   # legacy ViPER4Android XML  ->  v2
   python3 tools/convert_preset.py preset.xml -o preset.v2.json
   ```

The input format (v1 JSON vs. XML) and, for v1 JSON, the headphone/speaker namespace are auto-detected.
Missing fields are filled with the app defaults. Import the resulting `.v2.json` in the app.

> [!NOTE]
> v2 no longer stores separate headphone and speaker copies inside a preset. A preset now holds a
> single unified effect state and is applied to a device through the per-device profile system.

## Per-Device Profiles

Each audio output device keeps its **own** full effect profile. When you switch outputs, the app
automatically loads the incoming device's profile, so your speaker, wired earphones, and each pair
of Bluetooth buds all remember their own tuning.

### How a device is identified

The active output is detected from the Android audio routing API, and each device gets a stable `deviceId`:

- **Speaker** → `speaker`
- **Wired headphone / headset** → `wired_headphone`
- **Bluetooth** (A2DP / BLE / hearing aid) → the device's **MAC address** (falls back to `bt_<id>` if unavailable)
- **USB DAC / headset** → the USB device **address** (falls back to `usb_<id>`)

Because Bluetooth and USB devices are keyed by their hardware address, two different pairs of buds
are stored separately, and reconnecting the same device restores exactly its profile. The display
name comes from the device's reported product name (e.g. "Galaxy Buds Pro"), with a type-based fallback ("Bluetooth A2DP", "USB Audio", ...).

### When profiles are saved and loaded

- **On output switch**: the app detects the new active device, **loads** its profile.
- **On app background** (home button, app switch / `ON_STOP`) and **on shutdown**: the current settings are saved to the active device's profile.
- **First time a device is seen**: a profile is created automatically from the current settings.

### Managing profiles

Open the **Devices dialog** to manage saved profiles. There you can **save** the current settings to
a device, **load** a device's profile into the current settings, **rename** a device, or **delete** a
profile. Deleting a profile removes its saved settings, the device gets a fresh profile the next time it connects.

## Root Access

This app may require root access for:

- **AIDL mode**: Creating shared memory files for the AIDL driver (if not set up during module installation)
- **Per-App Mode**: Retrieving real audio session IDs via `dumpsys`
- **Convolver**: Copying IRS/WAV files to `/data/local/tmp/v4a/` for the driver to read (AIDL only)
- **Debug log viewer**: Reading `logcat` for driver diagnostics

Please make sure the source of any modified APK is trustworthy to avoid any security risks.
